## Installation

This package does not utilize any native modules, so to install, just:

`npm install --save react-native-meteor`

Then in your code, make sure you run [`Meteor.connect`](/docs/api.md) to connect to your server.

**Note**: this module contains _breaking changes_, so it will not work for React Native versions under 0.60.0.
